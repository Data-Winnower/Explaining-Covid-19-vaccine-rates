R notebook with data import, wrangling, modeling and report with data analysis.

This report was done as a class project for ECON300 and Fredonia State, Fall 2021. 
THe assignment was essentially to find some data, make an initial hypothesis 
about what the data would show, create a single factor linear regression model, 
and interpret that model.

I took it a little further than that.
